Q1.What if the .pem key file or the .ppk key file to our ec2 machine is lost?
Ans1. Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.

1. First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.

2. Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.

3. Goto EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.

4. Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

5. Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

6. Execute below commands:
# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
# cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
# umount /mnt
7. Detach the secondary volume from helper instance. 

8. Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.

Use helper instance pem file to log into recovery instance.

Q2.Difference between OLAP and OLTP
Ans2. The differences between OLAP and OLTP are:
1.OLAP stands for Online analytical processing (data warehouse) while OLTP stands for Online transaction processing (operational system).
2.OLTPs are the original sources of the data while PLAP data comes from the various OTLP databases.
3.OLAP helps with planning, problem solving and decision support while OLTP used to control and run fundamental business tasks.
4.In OLAP, the inserts and updates are periodic long-running batch jobs while in OLTP they are short and fast which are initiated by end users.
5.OLAP space requirements are larger compared to OLTP as it requires more indexes than OLAP
6.OLAP's database design are typically de-normalized with fewer tables while in OLTP they are highly normalized with many tables.
